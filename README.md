# Project Directory Structure

## /database

- **/main**: Contains the SQLite file for the main application database.
- **/license**: Contains the SQLite file for licensing information.
- **databaseConfig.js**: Manages connections and configurations for the SQLite databases.
- **/migrations**: Contains scripts for database schema migrations.

## /models

Holds files defining the data structures for ORM or direct database interactions.

## /controllers

Contains business logic to handle API requests, separating CRUD operations by resource (e.g., employees, projects).

## /routes

Defines endpoints for API interactions, linking to the appropriate controllers.

## /utils

Utility scripts like database helpers and error handling to support operations across controllers and models.

## /services

Services such as licenseService.js manage complex logic like license verification that might interact across multiple databases.

## /logs

Keeps track of runtime operations, especially license verifications, to aid in debugging and auditing.

# Next Steps

With this structure, you are prepared to start coding each component. The process involves:

- **Database Configuration and Migration Scripts**: Set up and maintain database schemas.
- **Model Definitions**: Create models for each table in your databases.
- **Controller Implementation**: Write logic for handling requests and integrating model operations.
- **Route Setup**: Define routes that map to controller actions.
- **Utility and Service Layer**: Implement necessary utility functions and complex service operations.
- **Logging**: Establish logging mechanisms for critical operations.
